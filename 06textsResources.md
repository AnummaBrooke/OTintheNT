## Texts and Resources:

_I agree_ to provide resources that will provoke and challenge us, in order to invite our alert engagement of genuine questions. _You agree_ to make consistently rigorous use of the fullness of those resources, recognizing that they are carefully chosen and that they can not simply be substituted with alternative approaches to preparation. _You agree_ to recognize that the course may demand that we engage material that proves offensive to some of us, whether in its theology, its irreverence, or its language. Our conviction is that any offense is outweighed by the opportunity for critical reasoning and unexpected learning that such sources provide us. If this is unacceptable to you, then you should strongly consider not taking this class.
