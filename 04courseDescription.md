## Course Description:

The New Testament frequently refers to the Old Testament. In this course, students will read select examples of such references, asking first how the OT text functions in its own literary and historical context, then also how the reference functions in its own NT context. 

**Knowing** how the biblical authors re-appropriate scripture, students will critically assess those re-appropriations and their own **doing** of the same, with the goal of **being** more informed and self-critical interpreters of OT and NT texts.

Students may take the course as an OT or NT required elective, with their work being shaped accordingly. Because we will exegete OT and NT texts, both 11-500 and 12-500 are prerequisites for this course.
