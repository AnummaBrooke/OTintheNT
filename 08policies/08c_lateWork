### Late Work:

Written work is due by the dates and times set in the schedule (below) and in its rubrics. Late individual work will be penalized one letter grade for the first 24 hours, one letter grade during the second 24 hours, and so on. Please plan your work so that an acute crisis—brief illness, computer or internet trouble, locusts—does not interfere with timely accomplishment of course work.**Emergency:** occasionally, a student may require a sudden absence from the institution because of a genuine and time-consuming emergency. Such a matter should be brought to the attention of the Dean of Students without delay. At the Dean’s discretion, a plan for completion of missed work might be arranged. This protects the student from unintended difficulties that can arise if she tries to make separate arrangements with individual professors.
