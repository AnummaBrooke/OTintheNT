We agree to be fully present to our classmates during our sessions. Phones and laptops will only be used _in ways directly related to activities underway_ during our class time. Students may not accept phone calls or TMs during class, nor engage in side conversations and side texting. Web-surfing not related to the activity underway is profoundly discourteous and will not be permitted. At the same time, there should be many opportunities for course-related use of the Web and of social media.
