### Attendance: 

_I agree_ to do my part to make sessions worth attending. _Sessions will not simply reproduce the readings._ A stimulating variety of kinds of interaction will be planned. Students will be given opportunity to share discoveries, display accomplishments, deepen understanding, and be tested by one another and by me. _You agree to be present at all sessions._ We are available to one another in class for conversation, challenge, and support, on the working hypothesis that "a rising tide lifts all boats." Nobody is in the class only for herself and her grade: our contract is to "bootstrap" one another, and for that, we have to be present. If you do not assent to that understanding of attendance, you should strongly consider not taking this class.

For _every_ absence, the student will write a 500 word summary for each of the readings assigned for that class, due one week from the date of absence. _Every_ absence after the first will have a negative effect on one’s grade. _Any absence_ may result in re-evaluating a student's role in collaborative projects. Per the Student Handbook, students who miss 20% of sessions will not pass the course.

Tardiness: Please respect your classmates and our subject matter by arriving on time. Tardiness, especially excessive or frequent tardiness, also affects one’s grade. Opportunities missed on account of tardiness may not be made up.
